This project utilizes The Cat Api to display images of cats on the screen. To use this, you will need an API key which can be found (here)[https://thecatapi.com/signup]. If you are an employer considering me for a position, you can either use the link provided, or reach out to me, and I will happily provide my API key.

To run this code, please first use the terminal to cd into the proper directory and use command 'npm install' to install all dependencies for this project.

Once that is done, please use command 'npm run dev' to run the project. In your browser, please visit 'localhost:3000' to view the project.
